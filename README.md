Object detection framework using transfer learning.  

This framework helps you to create new models for any new objects by transfering the learning from existing trained models using, well, "transfter learning". This is achieved by extracting useful top layer learnt parameters from the suitable existing model and applying to a new model for given type of objects. The existing models are automatically selected and used by the framework or one could also manually feed.
